# Dark Mode E2E Test Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created comprehensive end-to-end tests for the dark mode functionality in the Phialo Design website. The tests are located in `/tests/e2e/dark-mode.spec.ts` and cover all 10 requested scenarios plus additional tests for better coverage.

## Test Coverage Implemented

### ✅ All 10 Requested Tests:

1. **Theme toggle button exists and is clickable** - Verified button visibility, enabled state, and proper ARIA labels
2. **Clicking toggle switches between light and dark modes** - Tests bidirectional switching and DOM class changes
3. **Background color changes when switching themes** - Validates RGB color values for both light and dark modes
4. **Text colors change appropriately** - Checks heading and text color transitions
5. **Theme preference persists after page reload** - Verifies localStorage persistence
6. **Theme preference persists during navigation** - Tests across multiple pages (/portfolio, /services, /contact, /about)
7. **System preference is respected on first visit** - Tests both light and dark system preferences
8. **All major components render correctly in both themes** - Validates header, nav, footer, hero section, and buttons
9. **Smooth transitions occur when switching themes** - Verifies 0.3s CSS transitions
10. **No flash of incorrect theme on page load** - Uses MutationObserver to detect theme flashing

### ✅ Additional Tests Implemented:

- **Theme toggle icon changes correctly** - Sun/moon icon transitions
- **Theme works with language switching** - Integration with Weglot
- **Keyboard accessibility** - Enter and Space key support
- **Cross-tab persistence** - Theme syncs across browser tabs
- **Mobile viewport testing** - Responsive dark mode behavior

## Key Implementation Details

### Technologies Used:
- **Playwright** for browser automation
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- Tests run on 5 browser configurations (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)

### Dark Mode Implementation:
- Uses Tailwind's class-based approach with `dark` class on `<html>` element
- Theme persisted in localStorage
- System preference detection via `prefers-color-scheme`
- Smooth 0.3s CSS transitions for all theme changes

### Test Improvements Made:
1. Fixed strict mode violations by using specific selectors
2. Handled browser compatibility issues (e.g., `evaluateOnNewDocument` → `addInitScript`)
3. Added mobile device detection to skip keyboard tests on touch devices
4. Improved selector specificity to avoid multiple element matches

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all dark mode tests
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/dark-mode.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui -- tests/e2e/dark-mode.spec.ts

# Run specific test
npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/dark-mode.spec.ts -g "Theme toggle button exists"
```

## Test Results

Based on the test runs:
- ✅ All core functionality tests pass across all browsers
- ✅ Mobile-specific tests properly skip keyboard navigation tests
- ✅ Theme persistence works correctly
- ✅ No theme flashing detected
- ✅ Smooth transitions verified

## Files Created/Modified

1. **`/tests/e2e/dark-mode.spec.ts`** - Complete test suite (495 lines)
2. **`/tests/e2e/DARK-MODE-TESTS.md`** - Detailed documentation
3. **`/tests/e2e/DARK-MODE-TEST-SUMMARY.md`** - This summary

## Color Reference

**Light Mode:**
- Background: `rgb(255, 255, 255)` (white)
- Text: `rgb(17, 24, 39)` (dark gray)

**Dark Mode:**
- Background: `rgb(10, 25, 47)` (dark blue)
- Text: `rgb(241, 245, 249)` (light gray)

## Next Steps

The dark mode tests are now comprehensive and production-ready. They can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure dark mode functionality remains stable across updates.
