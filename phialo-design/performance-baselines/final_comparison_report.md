- Build image: ~400MB (production-ready)

### 3. Advanced Features
- Multi-architecture support (amd64/arm64)
- Security scanning integrated
- Automatic image updates
- Smart caching strategies

## Implementation Highlights

### Phase 1: Foundation (✅ Complete)
- Docker registry setup with GHCR
- Performance baselines established
- Dockerfiles optimized

### Phase 2: Images (✅ Complete)
- Three specialized images created
- CI/CD pipeline for images
- Security scanning automated

### Phase 3: Migration (✅ Complete)
- Core workflows containerized
- Performance targets exceeded
- Full feature parity maintained

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Parallel Agent Approach**: Maximized implementation speed
