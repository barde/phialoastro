## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Dependency Installation Performance

Current dependency installation relies on pnpm with caching. Key metrics to track:

- **Cache hit rate**: Measure how often the pnpm store cache is utilized
- **Fresh install time**: Time taken when cache is missed
- **Cached install time**: Time taken when cache is hit
- **pnpm store size**: Current size of cached dependencies

### 2. Playwright Setup Performance

Playwright browser installation is a significant time consumer:

- **Browser download time**: Time to download Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Browser cache effectiveness**: How often browser cache is hit
- **Dependency installation**: System dependencies for browsers

### 3. Build Performance

Build times across different environments:

- **Development build**: Time for `npm run build` in dev mode
- **Production build**: Time for production optimized build
- **Asset generation**: Time spent on image optimization, bundling

### 4. Test Execution Performance

Test suite execution times:

- **Unit tests**: Average time for full unit test suite
- **E2E tests (single shard)**: Time for one shard of E2E tests
- **E2E tests (full matrix)**: Total time for all browser/device combinations
- **BrowserStack tests**: Remote testing performance

### 5. Parallelization Efficiency

Current parallelization strategy:

- **E2E sharding**: 4 shards with 2 workers each = 8 parallel executions
- **Matrix strategy**: Multiple OS/Node version combinations
- **Job dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel job execution

## Bottleneck Identification

Based on the analysis, the following bottlenecks have been identified:

### Critical Bottlenecks (>3 minutes impact)

1. **Playwright Browser Installation**
   - Current: ~2-3 minutes per job
   - Occurs in: E2E tests, nightly tests
   - Frequency: Every job without cache hit

2. **pnpm Dependency Installation**
   - Current: ~1-2 minutes (without cache)
   - Occurs in: All jobs
   - Cache miss rate: ~20% (estimated)

3. **E2E Test Execution**
   - Current: ~5-10 minutes (full suite)
   - Parallelization helps but still significant

### Moderate Bottlenecks (1-3 minutes impact)

1. **Build Process**
   - Current: ~1-2 minutes
   - Occurs in: Test jobs, deployment jobs

2. **Artifact Upload/Download**
   - Current: ~30-60 seconds per artifact
   - Multiplied across sharded tests

### Minor Bottlenecks (<1 minute impact)

1. **Checkout Action**
   - Current: ~10-20 seconds
   - Could be optimized with shallow clones

2. **Node.js Setup**
   - Current: ~15-30 seconds
   - Already optimized with caching

## Optimization Opportunities

### High Impact Optimizations

1. **Docker Container Pre-building**
   - Potential savings: 3-5 minutes per job
   - Include: Node.js, pnpm, Playwright browsers, dependencies

2. **Enhanced Caching Strategy**
   - Implement multi-level caching
   - Share caches across workflows where possible

3. **Workflow Consolidation**
   - Reduce redundant setup steps
   - Share artifacts more efficiently

### Metrics to Track Post-Containerization

1. **Job Startup Time**
   - Time from job start to first meaningful work
   - Target: <30 seconds

2. **Total Workflow Duration**
   - End-to-end time for each workflow
   - Target: 50% reduction

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - CPU/Memory usage
   - Container pull times

4. **Cache Hit Rates**
   - Docker layer cache hits
   - Dependency cache hits

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Set up automated performance tracking
   - Create dashboards for CI/CD metrics
   - Establish performance budgets

2. **Containerization Strategy**
   - Build base images with all dependencies
   - Implement layer caching effectively
   - Use matrix strategy for different test scenarios

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track performance trends over time
   - Alert on performance regressions
   - Regular performance reviews

## Appendix: Manual Measurements Needed

Some metrics require manual measurement or API access:

1. **Detailed Step Timings**
   - Access workflow run logs
   - Extract timing for each step
   - Calculate averages

2. **Cache Hit Rates**
   - Analyze cache action outputs
   - Track hit/miss ratios

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Monitor runner resource consumption
   - Identify resource constraints

*Note: This baseline will be compared against post-containerization metrics to measure improvement.*
