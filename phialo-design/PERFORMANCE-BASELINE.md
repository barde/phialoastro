# Performance Baseline Report

## Date: June 21, 2025

### Build Analysis
- **Total JavaScript**: ~353 KB (target: < 200KB)
- **Largest chunks**:
  - Main client bundle (client.BPIbHqJh.js): 179.41 KB (gzip: 56.51 KB)
  - Framer Motion (use-in-view.9n4zSAGs.js): 111.74 KB (gzip: 36.84 KB)
  - Portfolio component (Portfolio.DGYDaHmx.js): 29.85 KB (gzip: 10.23 KB)

### Key Observations
1. The main bundle is just under the 200KB target but close to the limit
2. Framer Motion is contributing significant weight (111.74 KB)
3. Multiple smaller chunks could potentially be optimized further

### Performance Opportunities
1. Optimize Framer Motion imports - currently loading entire library
2. Consider code splitting for heavy components
3. Implement font preloading to improve LCP
4. Add compression and HTTP/3 on Cloudflare
5. Self-host fonts to reduce external requests

## Next Steps
Begin with Phase 1 optimizations:
- Configure Cloudflare optimizations
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement font preloading
