# NOTE: All redirects have been temporarily removed due to an issue with Firefox showing
# "The page isn't redirecting properly" errors on Cloudflare Pages deployments.
#
# Issue details:
# - Site works correctly in local development environment
# - Redirects cause infinite loops on Cloudflare Pages deployments
# - Firefox detects this as a redirection that will never complete
#
# TODO: After the site is functioning properly on Cloudflare Pages,
# reimplement redirects one by one to determine which specific rule 
# is causing the issue.
#
# For reference, the original redirects included:
# - Domain redirects (www to non-www)
# - Legacy URL redirects (e.g., /jewelry/* to /portfolio/*)
# - Path normalization (removing trailing slashes)
# - Language-specific redirects

# Workers static assets doesn't support 404 status codes in _redirects
# 404 handling is now done in the worker script
