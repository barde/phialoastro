- Tests automatically adapt to UI changes without breaking
- Reduces maintenance overhead significantly

### Natural Language Processing
- Plain English test creation becoming standard
- Requirements and user stories automatically converted to tests
- Accessibility for non-technical team members

### Visual AI Testing
- Smart image comparison that ignores irrelevant differences
- AI determines if visual changes are actual bugs
- Reduced false positives compared to pixel-perfect comparisons
