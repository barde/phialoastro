# Web Vitals Monitoring Options

## Current Implementation Status

The Core Web Vitals monitoring code is implemented and collecting metrics, but **there's no visualization infrastructure set up yet**. The metrics are being sent to `/api/vitals` endpoint which can store them in Cloudflare KV, but KV is just a key-value store - not a proper metrics database.

## Recommended Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Grafana Cloud (RECOMMENDED)
**Best for**: Professional monitoring with minimal setup

Grafana Cloud provides a complete observability stack with free tier (10k series, 50GB logs, 50GB traces).

**Setup**:
1. Sign up for [Grafana Cloud Free](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/)
2. Modify `functions/api/vitals.js` to send metrics to Grafana Cloud using Prometheus Remote Write API
3. Use pre-built Core Web Vitals dashboards

**Pros**:
- Professional dashboards out of the box
- Alerting capabilities
- No infrastructure to maintain
- Generous free tier

**Cons**:
- External dependency
- Data leaves your infrastructure

### Option 2: Cloudflare Analytics Engine (BEST INTEGRATED)
**Best for**: Staying within Cloudflare ecosystem

Cloudflare Analytics Engine is purpose-built for metrics at edge.

**Setup**:
```javascript
// In functions/api/vitals.js
export async function onRequestPost({ request, env }) {
  const { metrics, context } = await request.json();
  
  // Write to Analytics Engine
  metrics.forEach(metric => {
    env.ANALYTICS.writeDataPoint({
      indexes: [metric.name, context.pageType], 
      blobs: [context.path, context.sessionId],
      doubles: [metric.value]
    });
  });
  
  return new Response('OK');
}
```

Then query via Cloudflare GraphQL API or dashboard.

**Pros**:
- Native Cloudflare integration
- Designed for edge metrics
- Fast queries
- Pay-per-use pricing

**Cons**:
- Less mature than other solutions
- Limited visualization options

### Option 3: Vercel Analytics
**Best for**: Simplest setup, zero configuration

**Setup**:
```bash
pnpm add @vercel/analytics web-vitals
```

Replace WebVitalsMonitor with:
```astro
---
// In BaseLayout.astro
---
<script>
  import { inject } from '@vercel/analytics';
  import { injectWebVitals } from '@vercel/analytics/web-vitals';
  
  inject();
  injectWebVitals();
</script>
```

**Pros**:
- Zero configuration
- Automatic dashboards
- Works even if not hosted on Vercel

**Cons**:
- Costs $10/month after free tier
- Another external service

### Option 4: PostHog
**Best for**: Product analytics + performance monitoring

**Setup**:
```bash
pnpm add posthog-js
```

```javascript
// In WebVitalsMonitor.astro
import posthog from 'posthog-js';

posthog.init('YOUR_API_KEY', {
  api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com',
  capture_performance: true
});

// Metrics automatically captured
```

**Pros**:
- Combines product analytics with performance
- Self-hostable option available
- Session recordings
- Generous free tier (1M events/month)

**Cons**:
- Heavier client library
- May be overkill for just Web Vitals

### Option 5: Google Analytics 4
**Best for**: If you're already using GA

**Setup**:
```javascript
// In WebVitalsMonitor.astro
function sendMetricsBatch() {
  if (typeof gtag !== 'undefined') {
    metricsQueue.forEach(metric => {
      gtag('event', 'web_vitals', {
        name: metric.name,
        value: Math.round(metric.value),
        rating: metric.rating,
        delta: metric.delta,
        event_category: 'Web Vitals'
      });
    });
  }
  metricsQueue = [];
}
```

View in GA4: Engagement → Events → web_vitals

**Pros**:
- Free
- Probably already set up
- Good enough for basic monitoring

**Cons**:
- Not specialized for performance metrics
- Limited aggregation options

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Solution | Setup Time | Cost | Features | Best For |
|----------|------------|------|----------|----------|
| Grafana Cloud | 30 min | Free-$50/mo | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Professional monitoring |
| CF Analytics Engine | 20 min | Pay-per-use | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Cloudflare users |
| Vercel Analytics | 5 min | Free-$10/mo | ⭐⭐⭐ | Quick setup |
| PostHog | 15 min | Free-$50/mo | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Product teams |
| Google Analytics | 10 min | Free | ⭐⭐ | Basic needs |

## My Recommendation

Since you're using Cloudflare Workers, I recommend:

1. **Short term**: Use **Cloudflare Analytics Engine** - it's already in your stack
2. **Long term**: If you need more sophisticated monitoring, migrate to **Grafana Cloud**

## What NOT to Do

- Don't build a custom dashboard from scratch
- Don't use Cloudflare KV as a metrics database (it's not designed for time-series data)
- Don't try to query metrics directly from KV at scale

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a solution** from above
2. **I can implement it** - just tell me which one
3. **Remove KV storage code** - it's not needed for any of these solutions

The current implementation is sending metrics but they're going into a black hole (KV storage without visualization). Pick a proper monitoring solution and I'll update the implementation!
