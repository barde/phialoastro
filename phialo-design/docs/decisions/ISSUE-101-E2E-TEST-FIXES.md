# E2E Test Fixes Implementation

## Overview
This document details the fixes implemented for E2E test failures as part of Issue #101.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Mobile Navigation Tests ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Mobile navigation tests were failing due to unreliable element selectors and hydration issues.

**Solution**:
1. Added `data-testid` attributes to mobile navigation components:
   - `data-testid="mobile-menu-button"` on the hamburger menu button
   - `data-testid="mobile-menu-panel"` on the mobile menu container
   - `data-testid="mobile-menu-backdrop"` on the overlay
   - `data-testid="mobile-menu-close"` on the close button
   - `data-testid="mobile-nav-{path}"` on navigation links

2. Updated test selectors to use data-testid attributes for reliability
3. Replaced arbitrary timeouts with proper wait conditions
4. Removed the `test.skip()` from mobile navigation tests

**Files Modified**:
- `src/shared/navigation/Navigation.tsx`
- `src/shared/navigation/MobileMenu.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`

### Phase 2: Fix Portfolio Modal Click Outside ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The portfolio modal click outside test was failing because the click handler wasn't properly attached to the backdrop.

**Solution**:
1. Added `onClick={onClose}` handler to the backdrop overlay
2. Added `data-testid="modal-backdrop"` for test targeting
3. Updated test to use mouse position click (10, 10) to avoid modal content interference

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/portfolio/components/PortfolioModal.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/portfolio-modal.spec.ts`

### Phase 3: Remove Dark Mode Tests ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Dark mode tests were scattered across multiple test files as skipped or commented code, creating maintenance overhead.

**Solution**:
1. Created `tests/future/` directory for unimplemented feature tests
2. Moved all dark mode tests to `tests/future/dark-mode.spec.ts`
3. Replaced dark mode test code with references to the future test file
4. Created README documentation for future tests

**Files Created**:
- `tests/future/dark-mode.spec.ts` - Comprehensive dark mode test suite
- `tests/future/README.md` - Documentation for future tests

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/e2e/integration.spec.ts` - Removed 5 dark mode test references
- `tests/e2e/responsive.spec.ts` - Removed 1 dark mode test

### Additional Fix: URL Trailing Slash
**Problem**: Language switching test was expecting exact URL match without trailing slash.

**Solution**: 
- Updated test to use regex pattern `/\/en\/portfolio\/?/` to accept URLs with or without trailing slash

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- Mobile navigation tests: **SKIPPED**
- Portfolio modal click outside: **FAILED**
- Dark mode tests: **SKIPPED** (5 tests)
- Critical tests: **FAILING**

### After Fixes
- Mobile navigation tests: **PASSING** ‚úÖ
- Portfolio modal tests: **ALL PASSING** (30 tests) ‚úÖ
- Dark mode tests: **MOVED TO FUTURE** üìÅ
- Critical tests: **ALL PASSING** (15 tests) ‚úÖ

## Impact

1. **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now use stable selectors and proper wait conditions
2. **Better Code Organization**: Future features are documented but not cluttering active tests
3. **Faster CI/CD**: Removed skipped tests reduce confusion and test execution time
4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Clear separation between implemented and planned features

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Improve Test Infrastructure (Optional)
While not critical, the following improvements could further enhance the test suite:
1. Implement Page Object Model for better test maintenance
2. Add visual regression tests for UI consistency
3. Create mobile-specific test utilities
4. Enhance test reporting and error messages

## Lessons Learned

1. **Use data-testid attributes**: More reliable than CSS selectors for E2E tests
2. **Handle hydration properly**: React components need proper wait conditions
3. **Separate future features**: Keep unimplemented feature tests in a dedicated directory
4. **Be flexible with assertions**: Use regex patterns for URLs that might have variations
