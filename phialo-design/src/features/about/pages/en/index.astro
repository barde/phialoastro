            Hello! I am Gesa Pickbrenner, founder of Phialo.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            From an early age, I was fascinated by all things artistic. Drawing, painting, and sculpture have always been my way of expressing creative energy.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            In 2015, I completed my training in traditional goldsmithing as the top graduate in Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein. Passing on knowledge is especially important to me, which is why I also hold an official qualification as a craft instructor. This has helped me serve the community: by creating online courses that have reached around 10,000 people so far. I also offer private lessons.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            I am self-taught in 3D design and illustration. For over 10 years, I have been bringing creative ideas to life with 3D and turning them into reality through 3D printing and goldsmithing. I have guided numerous clients from idea to finished project and created various jewelry collections as well as unique pieces.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            In 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Fernuni Hagen. I combine artistic vision with a high standard of education and a strong sense for rational and efficient approaches.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            As a teacher, I am committed to helping everyone find their own unique creative expression and artistic voice. As a craftsperson, I value a deep knowledge of both old and new technologies, such as 3D software, 3D printing, goldsmithing, and AI. As an artist, I love to take unconventional paths and create entirely new worlds of jewelry.
          </p>
