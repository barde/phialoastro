            Hi! I'm Gesa Pickbrenner.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            From a young age, I was mesmerized with anything artistic. Drawing, painting and sculpting have always been my way of expression.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            2015 I graduated in the traditional art of goldsmithing as the best graduate in the whole of Northern Germany. Having apprentices was always one of the more fun parts of being a craftswoman for me, so I also have an official degree in teaching for the arts+crafts. This has served me serving the community, in creating 8+ online courses reaching around 10000 students, and innumerable 1:1 sessions with my most dedicated students worldwide.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            I'm an autodidact in 3D design and illustration. For over 10 years, I've taught myself how to bring creative ideas to life with 3D and into the real world with 3D printing and goldsmithing. I accompanied numerous clients going from idea to finished project and created various jewelry collections as well as unique single pieces.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            In 2023 I graduated with a bachelor in economics. I combine an artistic vision with a high educational standard as well as a keen sense for the most rational and efficient approach.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
            I'm an advocate for finding your own unique creative expression and voice, as well as cultivating a deep knowledge base of the complex technology used, like 3D programs, 3D printing, goldsmithing, and even AI creation.
