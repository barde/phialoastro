### The Last On, First Off Rule

Jewelry should be the last thing you put on and the first thing you remove:

1. **After** applying makeup, perfume, and hair products
2. **Before** showering, swimming, or exercising
3. **Before** household cleaning or gardening
4. **Before** sleeping (except wedding bands)

### Handling Guidelines

- **Clean hands**: Always handle jewelry with clean, dry hands
- **Gentle touch**: Avoid touching gemstones; handle by the metal setting
- **One piece at a time**: Put on one piece at a time to avoid tangling
- **Check regularly**: Inspect clasps and settings for security

## Cleaning Different Materials

### Gold Jewelry

**Regular Cleaning** (weekly for frequently worn pieces):
1. Mix warm water with a few drops of mild dish soap
2. Soak jewelry for 10-15 minutes
3. Gently brush with a soft toothbrush
4. Rinse thoroughly with clean water
5. Pat dry with a soft, lint-free cloth

**Professional Cleaning**: Every 6 months for valuable pieces

### Silver Jewelry

**Tarnish Prevention**:
- Store in anti-tarnish bags or with chalk
- Keep away from air and moisture
- Remove before swimming (chlorine accelerates tarnishing)

**Cleaning Tarnish**:
1. Use a silver polishing cloth for light tarnish
2. For heavy tarnish, use commercial silver cleaner
3. Rinse thoroughly and dry completely
4. Never use abrasive materials

### Platinum Jewelry

**Advantages**: Naturally tarnish-resistant and hypoallergenic

**Cleaning**: Same method as gold, but platinum can handle slightly more vigorous brushing

**Professional Polish**: Annual professional polishing maintains luster

### Gemstone-Specific Care

#### Diamonds
- **Durability**: Hardest natural material (10 on Mohs scale)
- **Cleaning**: Can withstand ultrasonic and steam cleaning
- **Frequency**: Clean regularly as diamonds attract oils and dirt
- **Professional**: Annual check of prongs and settings

#### Emeralds
- **Fragility**: Often contain inclusions and may be oil-treated
- **Cleaning**: Gentle soap and water only
- **Avoid**: Ultrasonic cleaners, steam cleaning, harsh chemicals
- **Care**: Protect from impacts and temperature changes

#### Pearls
- **Delicate**: Organic gems requiring special care
- **After wearing**: Wipe with soft, damp cloth
- **Cleaning**: Mild soap solution, rinse quickly, air dry
- **Avoid**: Perfumes, cosmetics, acidic substances
- **Storage**: Lay flat in soft pouches, not plastic bags

#### Sapphires and Rubies
- **Durability**: Very hard (9 on Mohs scale)
- **Cleaning**: Soap and water, ultrasonic cleaning acceptable
- **Caution**: Some treatments may be affected by heat
- **Professional**: Check settings regularly due to hardness

#### Opals
- **Fragility**: Contain water and can crack
- **Cleaning**: Gentle soap and water, quick rinse
- **Avoid**: Sudden temperature changes, harsh chemicals
- **Storage**: Away from heat sources and direct sunlight

## Proper Storage

### General Principles

1. **Separate storage**: Each piece in its own compartment
2. **Soft surfaces**: Velvet, silk, or soft cotton lining
3. **Avoid tangles**: Lay necklaces flat or hang individually
4. **Climate control**: Cool, dry environment away from sunlight

### Storage Solutions

#### Jewelry Boxes
- **Multi-compartment**: Individual spaces for each piece
- **Lined compartments**: Soft fabric to prevent scratching
- **Secure closure**: Protection from dust and air exposure

#### Travel Storage
- **Individual pouches**: Soft fabric bags for each piece
- **Padded cases**: Protection during transport
- **Separate compartments**: Prevent pieces from rubbing together

#### Anti-Tarnish Options
- **Silver**: Anti-tarnish strips or treated storage bags
- **Copper alloys**: Silica gel packets to control moisture
- **Mixed metals**: Separate storage by metal type

## Professional Maintenance

### Annual Inspections

Professional jewelers should check:

- **Prong security**: Ensuring stones are held securely
- **Clasp function**: Smooth operation and proper closure
- **Chain integrity**: Links for wear or weakness
- **Setting stability**: No loosening of stones
- **General condition**: Overall wear assessment

### Professional Services

#### Cleaning
- **Ultrasonic cleaning**: Safe for most diamonds and sapphires
- **Steam cleaning**: Effective for durable stones
- **Hand cleaning**: Best for delicate or treated stones

#### Repair Services
- **Prong retipping**: Replacing worn prong ends
- **Chain repair**: Fixing broken or weak links
- **Clasp replacement**: Updating worn or insecure clasps
- **Rhodium plating**: Refreshing white gold finish

#### Restoration
- **Stone replacement**: Matching lost or damaged gems

- **Modernization**: Updating vintage pieces while preserving character

## Warning Signs

### When to Seek Professional Help

Contact a jeweler immediately if you notice:

- **Loose stones**: Any movement when gently pressed
- **Damaged prongs**: Bent, broken, or worn thin
- **Chain issues**: Kinks, weak spots, or stretched areas
- **Clasp problems**: Difficulty closing or staying closed
- **Color changes**: Unexpected darkening or discoloration
- **Surface damage**: Deep scratches or chips

## Insurance and Documentation

### Protection Strategies

1. **Photography**: Detailed photos of each piece
2. **Appraisals**: Professional valuations every 3-5 years
3. **Insurance**: Specific jewelry coverage or riders
4. **Documentation**: Keep all certificates and receipts

### Record Keeping

Maintain files with:
- Purchase receipts and certificates
- Professional appraisal documents
- Insurance policy details
- Service and repair records
- Detailed photographs

## Lifestyle Considerations

### Activity-Specific Guidelines

#### Exercise and Sports
- Remove all jewelry before physical activity
- Sweat and impact can damage settings and stones
- Even wedding bands should be removed for contact sports

#### Swimming
- **Chlorine**: Extremely damaging to gold alloys
- **Salt water**: Corrosive to most metals
- **Temperature**: Sudden changes can crack stones

#### Household Tasks
- **Cleaning products**: Harsh chemicals damage most materials
- **Gardening**: Dirt and impacts can loosen stones
- **Cooking**: Heat and acids can affect various materials

## Building Good Habits

### Daily Routine

1. **Morning**: Check pieces before putting them on
2. **Evening**: Clean removal and proper storage
3. **Weekly**: Quick inspection and gentle cleaning if needed
4. **Monthly**: Thorough cleaning and detailed inspection
5. **Annually**: Professional evaluation and maintenance

### Long-term Care

- **Rotation**: Wear different pieces to reduce wear on favorites
