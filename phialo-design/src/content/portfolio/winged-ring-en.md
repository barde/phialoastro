## Winged Ring

Bespoke winged ring with intricate details, 3D-printed and cast in yellow gold, set with custom cut roman glass, finished with sandblasting and polishing.

### Materials

- **18kt gold**
- **Ancient green roman glass**

### Craftsmanship

This extraordinary ring combines cutting-edge 3D printing technology with traditional goldsmithing techniques. The complex wing design was first digitally modeled and then realized through 3D printing in wax before being cast in 18-karat gold.

### Special Features

The centerpiece of the ring features a specially cut piece of ancient Roman glass in vibrant green. The surface has been refined through a combination of sandblasting and polishing, creating a captivating contrast between matte and glossy areas.
