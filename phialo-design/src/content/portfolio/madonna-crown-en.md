## Silver Madonna Crown

This project was something very special: a Madonna figure located in a church in Japan was to be adorned with a crown by my client. A miniature template with rough details was available as a starting point.

### Project Process

- **Starting Point**: Miniature template with rough details
- **Design**: 3D model based on the template
- **Collaboration**: Close coordination for optimal casting
- **Finishing**: Gilded details and diamonds added by the client
- **Destination**: Japan, where it now crowns a Madonna figure

### Craftsmanship Details

Based on this template, I created the 3D model and worked closely with the client to ensure everything would fit together perfectly after casting. The gilded details and diamonds were then added by my client at the end.

### Cultural Bridge

This crown represents a unique cultural bridge between German craftsmanship and Japanese religious art. The noble headpiece traveled with an enthusiastic client to Japan, where it now serves its sacred purpose.

### Technical Specifications

- **Primary Material**: Sterling silver
- **Accent Details**: 24k gold gilding
- **Gemstone Setting**: Hand-selected diamonds and precious stones
- **Construction**: Multi-piece assembly for complex geometries
- **Finish**: Museum-quality polish and patination

### Symbolic Elements

The crown incorporates traditional religious iconography while respecting both European and Japanese aesthetic sensibilities. Each element was carefully researched and designed to honor the sacred nature of its intended use.

### International Collaboration

This project exemplifies the global nature of contemporary jewelry design, where traditional craftsmanship techniques meet international artistic vision. The successful completion required coordination across continents and cultural boundaries.
