## Castle Piggy Bank

The transformation of a real castle into a valuable coin box. With authentic proportions - just much smaller than the original, which stands in Schleswig-Holstein. Material: Sterling silver, the second iteration consists entirely of 750/- gold.

### Manufacturing

In collaboration with Herterich GmbH. A 3D wax print was created from the 3D model, which was then cast in precious metal. With great craftsmanship, the locking system was developed and the surface refined.

### Project Highlights

- **Material**: Sterling Silver, 18kt Yellow Gold
- **Function**: Openable coin box with coin slot
- **Technique**: 3D modeling based on original castle
- **Project Duration**: 7 months (3 months for 3D model)
- **Weight**: Approximately 2kg
- **Dimensions**: 150x55x65mm

### Architectural Precision

This project required exceptional attention to architectural detail. Every turret, wall, and decorative element had to be carefully scaled and adapted for the functional requirements of a coin box while maintaining the castle's recognizable character.

### Functional Design

The decorative element in the roof - the tympanum, designed according to the original coat of arms - serves as a push button to open the box. This ingenious integration of form and function exemplifies the marriage of art and utility.

### Historical Reference

By recreating an actual historical castle, this piece bridges past and present, transforming architectural heritage into functional art. The attention to historical accuracy makes it both a savings device and a cultural artifact.

### Technical Challenges

- **Scale adaptation**: Reducing complex architecture to jewelry scale
- **Mechanical function**: Integrating opening mechanism seamlessly
- **Material transition**: Combining silver and gold elements
- **Weight distribution**: Ensuring stability despite the top-heavy design

### Collectible Appeal

This unique piece appeals to collectors of both fine metalwork and architectural miniatures. Its dual function as both savings bank and display piece makes it exceptionally versatile.
