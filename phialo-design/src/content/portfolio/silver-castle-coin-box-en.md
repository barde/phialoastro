## Silver Castle Coin Box

This project was extraordinary and very exciting. The castle was to be replicated in silver as a coin box that opens, with a coin slot in the "chimney". An excursion to the castle, numerous photos, and detailed remodeling as a 3D model made the implementation possible.

### Project Highlights

- **Material**: Silver with golden details
- **Function**: Openable coin box with coin slot
- **Technique**: 3D modeling based on original castle
- **Project Duration**: 7 months (3 months for 3D model)
- **Weight**: Approximately 2kg
- **Dimensions**: 150x55x65mm

### Architectural Precision

This project required exceptional attention to architectural detail. Every turret, wall, and decorative element had to be carefully scaled and adapted for the functional requirements of a coin box while maintaining the castle's recognizable character.

### Functional Design

The decorative element in the roof - the tympanum, designed according to the original coat of arms - serves as a push button to open the box. This ingenious integration of form and function exemplifies the marriage of art and utility.

### Collaborative Excellence

The model was cast and assembled in collaboration with Roger Cermak, ensuring the highest standards of precious metal craftsmanship. The collaboration brought together 3D design expertise with traditional goldsmithing skills.

### Historical Reference

By recreating an actual historical castle, this piece bridges past and present, transforming architectural heritage into functional art. The attention to historical accuracy makes it both a savings device and a cultural artifact.

### Technical Challenges

- **Scale adaptation**: Reducing complex architecture to jewelry scale
- **Mechanical function**: Integrating opening mechanism seamlessly
- **Material transition**: Combining silver and gold elements
- **Weight distribution**: Ensuring stability despite the top-heavy design

### Collectible Appeal

This unique piece appeals to collectors of both fine metalwork and architectural miniatures. Its dual function as both savings bank and display piece makes it exceptionally versatile.

### Cultural Significance

The project demonstrates how traditional craftsmanship can preserve and celebrate architectural heritage in miniature form, creating lasting connections between place, memory, and artisanship.
