- Keyboard arrow keys navigate images
- Indicator dots navigate to specific images

✅ **Accessibility Tests (5 tests)**
- Proper ARIA attributes

## Key Achievements

1. **100% Feature Coverage**: All requested test scenarios have been implemented
2. **Accessibility First**: Comprehensive a11y testing including ARIA, focus management, and keyboard navigation
3. **Edge Cases**: Handled scenarios like empty arrays, missing props, and rapid interactions
4. **Integration Testing**: Full user flow testing from grid to modal and back
5. **Maintainable Tests**: Clear structure, good naming, and proper cleanup

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests once (no watch)
npm test -- --run

# Run with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test PortfolioModal.test.tsx
```

## Notes

- All tests follow React Testing Library best practices
- Mocks are properly set up for external dependencies (framer-motion, lucide-react)
- Tests are isolated and don't affect each other
- Proper cleanup after each test (e.g., body overflow styles)
- Tests use semantic queries (getByRole, getByLabelText) for better accessibility testing

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Performance testing for large galleries
- Error boundary testing
- Touch/swipe gesture testing for mobile
- Animation completion testing
- Loading state tests if added to components
