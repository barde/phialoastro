# Portfolio Images Fix - Summary

## Issue
The portfolio page images were not displaying correctly or had layout issues in the grid.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. Complex LazyImage Component
**Problem**: The custom LazyImage component was over-engineered and potentially causing loading issues.
**Solution**: Replaced with simple `<img>` tags with native lazy loading.

### 2. Grid Layout Complexity  
**Problem**: Complex grid positioning logic and inconsistent CSS classes were causing layout issues.
**Solution**: Simplified the grid system with cleaner CSS and removed complex position calculations.

### 3. Conflicting Aspect Ratio Classes
**Problem**: The `aspect-square` class was conflicting with the grid's height management.
**Solution**: Removed conflicting classes and used proper height management in the grid container.

### 4. Missing Placeholder Image
**Problem**: LazyImage component referenced `/images/placeholder.jpg` which didn't exist.
**Solution**: Updated placeholder path to use existing `/images/profile.png`.
