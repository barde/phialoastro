1.  **Timeout Errors:** Multiple tests across Chromium, Firefox, and Mobile Safari are exceeding the 15-second timeout. This suggests that some operations are taking longer than expected in the CI environment.
2.  **Page Closed Errors:** The error `Error: page.evaluate: Target page, context or browser has been closed` indicates that the test is trying to interact with a page that is no longer available. This often happens when a navigation event occurs unexpectedly or the page crashes.
3.  **Navigation Errors:** The `Error: page.goto: NS_BINDING_ABORTED` in Firefox suggests that the navigation to the portfolio page was cancelled, possibly by another navigation starting before the first one finished.
4.  **Flaky Tests:** The "Complete user journey in German" test is marked as flaky, failing on the first run but passing on retry in one case, and failing consistently in others.
5.  **Missing Test Report:** The build log shows a warning that the `playwright-report` artifact was not uploaded because the path test-results did not contain any files. This means the test reporter is not configured to output to that directory.

The failing tests are:
*   `tests/e2e/integration.spec.ts`: "Complete user journey in German"
*   `tests/e2e/portfolio-comprehensive.spec.ts`: "portfolio modal should open with correct item"

The errors point to the helper function `openPortfolioModal` in portfolio-helpers.ts.

### Plan to Fix the Build

Here is a step-by-step plan to diagnose and fix these issues.

1.  **Analyze and Refactor the `portfolio-helpers.ts` file:**
    *   I will start by reading the portfolio-helpers.ts file to understand the logic inside the `openPortfolioModal` function.
    *   I will also examine integration.spec.ts and portfolio-comprehensive.spec.ts to see how this helper is being used.
    *   The primary goal is to add more robust waiting mechanisms. Instead of fixed timeouts, I will use Playwright's built-in waiting functions like `waitForSelector`, `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`, and expectations with `expect(...).toBeVisible()` to ensure the page is fully ready before any interaction.

2.  **Increase Test Timeout in Playwright Configuration:**
    *   While I refactor the tests to be more robust, I will also increase the global test timeout in the Playwright configuration to prevent premature test failure in the potentially slower CI environment. I will read playwright.config.ts and suggest an increase to the `timeout` property.

3.  **Correct the Test Report Output Path:**
    *   I will inspect the `playwright.config.ts` file to find the reporter configuration and adjust the `outputDir` for the test results to match the path expected by the GitHub Actions workflow (test-results). This will ensure that test reports are available for debugging on failed runs.

I will now proceed with reading the necessary files. I apologize for the error. I need to use absolute paths. I will correct this and retry reading the files. I have analyzed the test files and the Playwright configuration. The failures are happening in complex interaction scenarios within the portfolio, and the current helper function `openPortfolioModal` has some potential race conditions and uses fixed timeouts, which can be unreliable in a CI environment.

Here is my plan to fix the build:

1.  **Refactor portfolio-helpers.ts for Stability:** I will rewrite the `openPortfolioModal` function to be simpler and more robust. I will remove the manual retries and JavaScript-based clicks, and instead rely on Playwright's built-in auto-waiting and locators. This will make the tests less flaky and easier to debug. I will also add more descriptive logging.

2.  **Increase Test Timeouts:** The tests are timing out at 15 seconds, which might not be enough for the CI environment. I will increase the global timeout in playwright.config.ts to 60 seconds, and the expect timeout to 15 seconds, to give the tests more time to complete.

3.  **Correct Test Report Path:** The build log shows that the test report artifact is not being uploaded because the path is wrong. The tests are configured to output to `test-results`, but the CI workflow is looking for test-results. I will adjust the `outputDir` in playwright.config.ts to be an absolute path so the reports are saved in the correct location for the upload artifact step.

I will now provide the updated code for these files.

First, the updated portfolio-helpers.ts:
````typescript
import { Page, expect } from '@playwright/test';

/**
 * Sets up console error logging for a given Playwright page.
 * @param page The Playwright page object.
 * @returns An array to which console errors will be pushed.
 */
export function setupConsoleErrorLogging(page: Page) {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  page.on('console', msg => {
    if (msg.type() === 'error') {
      const errorText = `Console error: ${msg.text()}`;
      console.error(errorText);
      errors.push(errorText);
    }
  });
  
  page.on('pageerror', error => {
    const errorText = `Page error: ${error.message}`;
    console.error(errorText);
    errors.push(errorText);
  });
  
  return errors;
}

/**
 * A robust helper to open the portfolio modal.
 * It navigates to the portfolio page, waits for the content to be ready,
 * and then clicks the first portfolio item to open the modal.
 * @param page The Playwright page object.
 * @returns The locator for the portfolio modal.
 */
export async function openPortfolioModal(page: Page) {
  const errors = setupConsoleErrorLogging(page);

  // Navigate to the portfolio page if not already there.
  if (!page.url().includes('/portfolio')) {
    console.log('Navigating to portfolio page...');
    await page.goto('/portfolio', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
  } else {
    console.log('Already on portfolio page, ensuring network is idle...');
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  }

  // Wait for the main portfolio section to be visible.
  const portfolioSection = page.locator('.portfolio-section');
  await expect(portfolioSection).toBeVisible({ timeout: 15000 });
  console.log('Portfolio section is visible.');

  // Wait for the first portfolio item to be hydrated and ready for interaction.
  const firstItem = page.locator('[data-testid="portfolio-item"]').first();
  await expect(firstItem).toBeVisible();
  await expect(firstItem.locator('[data-testid="portfolio-details-button"]')).toBeEnabled({ timeout: 10000 });
  console.log('First portfolio item is ready.');

  // Hover over the item to reveal the details button.
  await firstItem.hover();
  console.log('Hovered over the first portfolio item.');

  // Click the details button to open the modal.
  const detailsButton = firstItem.locator('[data-testid="portfolio-details-button"]');
  await expect(detailsButton).toBeVisible();
  await detailsButton.click();
  console.log('Clicked the details button.');

  // Wait for the modal to appear and be visible.
  const modal = page.locator('[data-testid="portfolio-modal"]');
  await expect(modal).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });
  console.log('Portfolio modal is visible.');

  // Wait for the modal's title to be visible as a final check.
  const modalTitle = modal.locator('h2').first();
  await expect(modalTitle).toBeVisible();
  console.log('Modal title is visible.');

  // Check for any console errors during the process.
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    console.error('Console errors detected:', errors.join('\\n'));
  }

  return modal;
}
````

Next, here is the updated playwright.config.ts with increased timeouts and the corrected output directory:
````typescript

````

These changes should make the tests more reliable and fix the build failures. The refactored helper function is less prone to race conditions, and the increased timeouts will help in the CI environment. The corrected output path for test results will ensure that artifacts are correctly uploaded.

barde: check why the build failed. write a plan to fix the issue.

GitHub Copilot: Of course. I have analyzed the build log you provided. The build failed because several Playwright end-to-end tests are timing out or failing due to unreliable interactions with the web page, particularly around the portfolio modal. Additionally, the test result artifacts are not being saved correctly.

Here is the plan to fix the issue:

1.  **Stabilize the Test Helper:** The function `openPortfolioModal` in portfolio-helpers.ts contains complex logic with manual waits and fallback mechanisms that are causing flakiness. I will refactor it to use Playwright's standard, more reliable methods for waiting and interacting with elements.

2.  **Increase Timeouts:** The default 15-second timeout is not always sufficient for the tests to run in a CI environment. I will increase the global test and assertion timeouts in playwright.config.ts to prevent premature failures.

3.  **Correct Artifact Path:** The test reports are not being uploaded because they are being saved to the wrong directory. I will update the `outputDir` in playwright.config.ts to ensure the reports are generated in the location the CI workflow expects.

Here are the code changes to implement the plan:

# Fix_Issue_101.md

## Plan to Address Playwright E2E Test Failures and Flakiness

### 1. Analyze and Categorize Failures

#### a. Test Timeouts (15000ms exceeded)
- **Root Cause:** Likely due to slow page loads, unhandled async operations, or elements not being ready for interaction.
- **Action:** Review affected tests and increase timeouts where necessary. Add explicit waits for network idle, element visibility, or animation completion.

#### b. "page.evaluate: Target page, context or browser has been closed"
- **Root Cause:** Test code may be interacting with a page after it has been closed, possibly due to premature context teardown or navigation issues.
- **Action:** Audit test teardown logic. Ensure all async operations complete before closing the page/context. Add error handling for navigation and context closure.

#### c. "page.goto: NS_BINDING_ABORTED" and "locator.hover: Test timeout" (Firefox)
- **Root Cause:** Navigation aborted, possibly due to redirects, network issues, or test environment instability. Hover timeouts may indicate slow rendering or selector issues.
- **Action:** Add retry logic for navigation steps. Use more robust selectors. Add waits for element readiness before hover/interact actions.

#### d. Artifact Upload Fails (missing test-results directory)
- **Root Cause:** Directory not created if tests fail early or are skipped.
- **Action:** Update CI workflow to always create the directory, even if empty, before artifact upload.

### 2. Improve Test Reliability

- Add retries for flaky tests using Playwright's built-in retry mechanism.
- Use `waitForSelector` and `waitUntil: 'networkidle'` for navigation and element interactions.
- Refactor selectors to be more robust and less dependent on timing or animation.
- Ensure all test setup and teardown steps are properly awaited.

### 3. Optimize for CI Environment

- Review and optimize resource allocation (CPU/memory) for browsers in CI.
- Run tests in headless mode with reduced parallelism if resource contention is suspected.
- Add logging and screenshots on failure for easier debugging.

### 4. Documentation and Maintenance

- Document all changes and rationale in test files and CI workflow.
- Add a troubleshooting section for common Playwright errors in project docs.
- Schedule regular reviews of E2E test stability.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Audit and update affected test files as per above actions.
2. Update CI workflow to handle test-results directory.
3. Monitor test runs for improvement and iterate as needed.

This plan addresses the root causes, proposes actionable fixes, and outlines next steps for improving E2E test reliability.
