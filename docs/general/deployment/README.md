# Deployment Documentation Has Moved

The deployment documentation has been consolidated and moved to:

**[/phialo-design/docs/how-to/DEPLOY.md](../../../phialo-design/docs/how-to/DEPLOY.md)**

This consolidation was done to:
- Create a single source of truth for deployment instructions
- Remove duplicate and conflicting information
- Simplify maintenance and updates

Please update any bookmarks or references to point to the new location.
