# Issue #22 Fix Documentation

## Problem Statement
Portfolio modal shows German text on English pages. When viewing the English version of the portfolio page (`/en/portfolio`), clicking on portfolio items displays German content (e.g., "verbinden", "einzigartigen", "Diese") instead of English translations.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had three layers:

1. **Language Selector Auto-Redirect**: The `LanguageSelector` component was automatically redirecting users from `/en/portfolio` to `/portfolio` based on stored preferences, preventing access to English pages.

2. **React Hydration Mismatch**: In Astro's SSG environment, React components detected language differently on the server vs. client, causing the language prop to be lost during hydration.

3. **Non-Reactive Data**: The portfolio items were calculated once during initial render and weren't updating when the language changed after hydration. This was the primary cause of German content appearing on English pages.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Language Selector Fix
**File**: `src/components/layout/LanguageSelector.astro`

Modified to only auto-redirect on homepage visits:
```javascript
const isHomepage = currentPath === '/' || currentPath === '/en/' || currentPath === '/en';
if (isHomepage && preferredLang !== currentLang) {
  // redirect logic
}
```

### 2. Portfolio Modal Language Detection
**File**: `src/components/common/PortfolioModal.tsx`

Added URL-based language detection with proper hydration handling:
```typescript
const [detectedLang, setDetectedLang] = useState(lang);

useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const pathname = window.location.pathname;
    const urlLang = pathname.startsWith('/en') ? 'en' : 'de';
    setDetectedLang(urlLang);
  }
}, [lang, portfolioItem.category]);
```

### 3. Portfolio Component Data Reactivity
**File**: `src/components/sections/Portfolio.tsx`

Implemented `useMemo` to make portfolio items reactive to language changes:
```typescript
// Before (non-reactive):
const portfolioItems = getPortfolioItems(actualLang);

// After (reactive):
const portfolioItems = useMemo(() => getPortfolioItems(actualLang), [actualLang]);
```

### 4. Complete Content Translations
**File**: `src/components/sections/Portfolio.tsx`

Restructured portfolio data to include full translations:
```typescript
const portfolioContent = {
  de: {
    items: [
      {
        description: "Elegante Ohrhänger... verbinden wissenschaftliche Ästhetik...",
        materials: ["925er Silber", "Rhodiniert"],
        // ... etc
      }
    ]
  },
  en: {
    items: [
      {
        description: "Elegant earrings... combine scientific aesthetics...",
        materials: ["925 Silver", "Rhodium-plated"],
        // ... etc
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## Testing

### E2E Tests
Created comprehensive tests in `tests/e2e/portfolio-translations-comprehensive.spec.ts`:
- Checks for German words in English modals
- Verifies English translations for all content types
- Tests language consistency across modal opens
- Validates navigation between language versions

### Unit Tests
Added tests in `src/test/components/sections/Portfolio.test.tsx`:
- Verifies German content by default
- Tests English content when `lang="en"` is passed
- Validates URL-based language detection
- Ensures no German words appear in English modals

## Verification Steps

1. Navigate to `/en/portfolio`
2. Click on any portfolio item
3. Verify all content is in English:
   - Title (e.g., "DNA Spiral Earrings" not "DNA-Spirale Ohrhänger")
   - Category (e.g., "Earrings" not "Ohrringe")
   - Description (e.g., "combine" not "verbinden")
   - UI labels (e.g., "Materials" not "Materialien")

## Key Learnings

1. **React Hydration in SSG**: When using React components in Astro's SSG environment, always handle hydration mismatches with proper state management.

2. **Memoization for Reactive Data**: Use `useMemo` when derived data needs to update based on changing dependencies, especially for language-dependent content.

3. **URL as Source of Truth**: In multilingual SSG sites, use the URL path as the primary source of truth for language detection.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test not just UI labels but also all content data to ensure complete translations.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider moving portfolio content to Astro's content collections for better content management
2. Implement a more robust i18n solution using Astro's built-in i18n features
3. Add language detection middleware to ensure consistent language handling across all components
