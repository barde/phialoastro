# Issue #77: PR Test Optimizations

This document describes the optimizations made to the PR test workflow to improve CI performance while maintaining test quality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Path-Based Filtering
- Added `dorny/paths-filter` action to detect changed files
- Tests now run conditionally based on what was modified:
  - Unit tests: Run when frontend, tests, or config files change
  - E2E tests: Run when frontend, E2E tests, or config files change
  - All tests run for merge queue events

### 2. Reduced Node.js Matrix
- Changed from testing on Node 18.x, 20.x, and 22.x to only 20.x
- This reduces CI time by ~66% for unit tests
- Node 20.x is the current LTS version

### 3. Optimized E2E Test Configuration
- Increased Playwright workers from 1 to 4 for parallel execution
- Created dedicated `playwright.config.pr.ts` for PR tests
- Reduced browser matrix to critical ones:
  - Desktop: Chrome, Firefox (removed Safari)
  - Mobile: Safari (iOS), Chrome (Android)

### 4. Core E2E Test Suite
- PR runs only execute ~5 core test files instead of all 16:
  - `navigation.spec.ts` - Critical navigation functionality
  - `landing-page.spec.ts` - Homepage rendering
  - `portfolio-filtering.spec.ts` - Main feature testing
  - `contact-form.spec.ts` - Form functionality
  - `responsive.spec.ts` - Mobile responsiveness

### 5. Playwright Browser Caching
- Added caching for Playwright browsers
- Cache key based on Playwright version
- Significantly reduces E2E test setup time

### 6. Enhanced Test Summary
- Updated PR comment to show:
  - Which file categories changed
  - Which tests were skipped vs run
  - Clear indication of optimization details

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Local Testing
- Added `test:pr` script to run PR tests locally
- Added `test:e2e:pr` to run just core E2E tests
- Created `scripts/test-pr.sh` for complete PR test simulation

### Usage
```bash
# Run all PR tests locally (mimics CI)
pnpm run test:pr

# Run just core E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e:pr

# Run full E2E suite (for thorough testing)
pnpm run test:e2e
```

## Performance Impact

Expected improvements:
- Unit test time: ~66% reduction (3 Node versions â†’ 1)
- E2E test time: ~60% reduction (5 test files vs 16, 4 workers vs 1)
- Overall PR check time: ~50-60% reduction

## Trade-offs

- Less browser coverage in PRs (but critical ones are tested)
- Fewer E2E scenarios in PRs (but core functionality is covered)
- Full test suite still runs on merge to main

## Future Considerations

- Monitor test failures to ensure core suite catches most issues
- Consider adding more tests to core suite if gaps are found
- Evaluate adding test sharding for even more parallelization
