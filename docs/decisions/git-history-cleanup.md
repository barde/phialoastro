# Git History Cleanup - June 2025

## Summary
Performed a comprehensive git history cleanup to remove `workflow.log.zip` and all non-master branches.

## Actions Taken

### 1. History Rewrite
- Used `git filter-repo` to completely remove `workflow.log.zip` from all git history
- Force pushed the cleaned history to GitHub
- Repository size reduced to 25.38 MiB

### 2. Branch Cleanup
- Removed 21 branches (both local and remote)
- Only `master` branch remains
- All feature/fix branches were deleted after being merged

### 3. Prevention System Implemented
- Git hooks for pre-commit validation
- GitHub Actions workflow for file validation
- Comprehensive .gitignore patterns
- PR template with safety checklist

## Lessons Learned

### The Core Issue
PR #58 attempted to use `git filter-repo` but then **merged** the result instead of force-pushing. This preserved both old and new histories, defeating the purpose of history rewriting.

### Key Principle
When rewriting git history:
- **Never merge** - always force push
- Coordinate with team before force pushing
- Ensure all team members re-clone after history rewrite

## Future Prevention

1. **File Validation System**: Automatically blocks problematic files
2. **Two-Person Rule**: Force pushes require team coordination
3. **Regular Audits**: Monitor repository size and content

## Team Action Required
All team members must re-clone the repository or run:
```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

## Results
- ✅ No zip files in history
- ✅ Clean repository structure
- ✅ Prevention system active
- ✅ Only master branch remains
