# Repository Cleanup Summary - Issue #62

## Date: June 22, 2025
## Branch: feat/reduce-repo-size-issue-62

### Actions Taken

1. **Removed duplicate workers directory**
   - Path: `phialo-design/workers/`
   - Size: 193MB
   - Reason: Duplicate of the main `/workers/` directory with its own node_modules

### Space Saved

- **Before cleanup**: 849MB
- **After cleanup**: 656MB
- **Total space saved**: 193MB (22.7% reduction)

### Other Findings

1. **node_modules distribution** (not removed, needed for development):
   - `phialo-design/node_modules/`: 360MB
   - `workers/node_modules/`: 210MB
   - Total: 570MB (87% of current repo size)

2. **Other large directories** (kept as they're necessary):
   - `phialo-design/dist/`: 31MB (build output, already in .gitignore)
   - `.git/`: 26MB (version history)
   - `phialo-design/public/`: 26MB (static assets)

3. **Small cleanup candidates found** (not removed, minimal impact):
   - `.DS_Store` files: Multiple instances
   - Log files: 2 yarn-error.log files in node_modules
   - Cache: 8KB in node_modules/.cache

### Recommendations for Further Size Reduction

1. **Add to .gitignore** (if not already):
   - `**/.DS_Store`
   - `**/yarn-error.log`
   - `**/*.log`

2. **Consider using npm ci** instead of npm install in CI/CD to avoid package-lock changes

3. **Image optimization**: The `public/images/` directory could benefit from image optimization

### No Other Duplicates Found

The search for duplicate directories confirmed that `phialo-design/workers/` was the only significant duplicate directory in the repository.
