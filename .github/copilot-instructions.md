Use the Design concept from design-concepts/version1-minimalist-elegance.md as a reference for the design and layout of the Phialo Design homepage. The design should focus on minimalist elegance, with a sophisticated color scheme, refined typography, and a clean layout that highlights the luxury jewelry pieces. The navigation should be intuitive, with a fixed transparent header that transitions to white on scroll, and the hero section should feature a full viewport height display with centered content and subtle animations. The portfolio section should use an asymmetric grid layout to showcase the jewelry pieces effectively.
Use the technical specifications from project-structure-plan.md to implement the homepage using Astro. The project structure should include reusable components, layouts, and pages that follow Astro best practices. Ensure that the homepage is optimized for performance and SEO, with static HTML generation and automatic image optimization. The code should be clean, modular, and easy to maintain, allowing for future enhancements and scalability.
Use the framework recommendation from framework-recommendation.md to guide the implementation of the homepage. Astro is recommended for its static site capabilities, component flexibility, and excellent performance. Ensure that the homepage leverages Astro's features such as partial hydration, automatic image optimization, and built-in SEO support. The code should be written in TypeScript where applicable, and utilize Astro's component system to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
