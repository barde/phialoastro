# Email Service Timeout Fix

## Problem
The contact form was experiencing timeouts when sending emails through Cloudflare Workers. The root cause was an unnecessary API call to check provider availability before sending emails.

## Solution
Removed the blocking `isAvailable()` check in the email provider that was making an extra API call to Resend before sending emails. This check was:
- Unnecessary - if the API is down, the send attempt will fail anyway
- Blocking - doubled the latency by making two sequential API calls
- Causing timeouts - Workers have limited execution time

## Changes Made

1. **ResendEmailProvider**: 
   - Changed `isAvailable()` to always return `true`
   - Removed the unnecessary API call to `/domains` endpoint

2. **EmailService**:
   - Removed the `isAvailable()` check before sending
   - Improved logging throughout the email flow
   - Better error handling and messages

3. **Added Tests**:
   - Unit tests for EmailService
   - Unit tests for ResendEmailProvider
   - Unit tests for contact form handler
   - All tests passing

## Result
- Contact form now responds quickly without timeouts
- Single API call instead of two
- Better error messages and logging
- Full test coverage for email functionality

## Configuration
No changes to configuration needed. Continue using:
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Sender email address
- `TO_EMAIL`: Recipient for contact forms
